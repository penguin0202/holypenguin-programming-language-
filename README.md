# holypenguin-programming-language-
A more than bare-bones programming language inspired by c and c#, written in python, without those nasty classes in use

For a long time now, I've wanted to create a programming language, the main reason is that I wanted something to be MINE, or rather, MY OWN CREATION, something I can call "FROM SCRATCH" (and also the fact that every language I've encountered has flaws and I think I know best despite not even reaching an intermediate level of code).
During the summer, along with other projects I've written in python, I've had this compiler project too.
I did not think of uploading my works to github, so...yeah no significant progress can be shown for the lexer, parser, and parts of the semantic analyzer. (no proof = didn't do it?)
Anyway, that's about it, this is a compiler (translates text files into assembly code, and let the REAL smart people assemble the code into binary) written in python without classes, I specify no classes because every tutorial I've come across is just filled with class related stuff like __init__ or whatever the fuck, it's just annoying, everything's indented, there's duplicate naming of variables (I'm talking about how you have to (a variation of because I forgor) write "this.name = name"), I loath everything about classes.
Instead, my code is just functions and variables (mostly dicts and strings)
